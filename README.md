3 Features:

1. Calender with Korbanot:
	The file generates the proper korbanot for each day and generates them on 
	a hebrew calender.

2. Maaser calculator:
	The file calculates how much Maaser an idividual is supposed to give based 
	on the amount of money that they make, specifying how much money is going 
	to each part of the maaser.

3. Tamei exposure checker:
	The file uses a registry to track people the user has been in contact with 
	in the past 24 hours that are registered on the system. If one person is Tamei
	you get a notification that you have been exposed and should go to a mikvah.
